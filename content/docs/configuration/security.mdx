Memos is self-hosted by design. You control the infrastructure, storage, and access policies.

## Recommended settings

- Set a public instance URL with `MEMOS_INSTANCE_URL` when running behind a reverse proxy.
- Disable user registration if your instance is private.
- Disable public memo visibility if you do not want any public content.

## Operational guidance

- Run Memos behind HTTPS in production.
- Back up your database regularly.
- Limit access to the admin account and rotate credentials as needed.
