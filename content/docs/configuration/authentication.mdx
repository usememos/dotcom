Authentication behavior is controlled through instance settings.

## Registration and password auth

Admins can enable or disable:

- User registration
- Password-based sign-in
- Username and nickname changes

These settings are exposed via the Instance Settings API and the admin UI.

## OAuth2 identity providers

Memos supports OAuth2 identity providers for SSO. Configure providers in the admin settings to allow users to sign in with external accounts.
