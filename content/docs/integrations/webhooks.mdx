description: Configure webhooks to integrate Memos with external services and automate workflows based on memo events.
---

Webhooks allow Memos to automatically notify external services when events occur, enabling powerful integrations and automation workflows. This guide covers webhook configuration, event types, and practical integration examples.

## Overview

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that Memos sends to external URLs when specific events happen in your instance. They enable real-time integrations with communication tools (Slack, Discord), automation services (Zapier, IFTTT), and development platforms (GitHub, Jira).

## Webhook Configuration

### Creating Webhooks

Webhooks can be configured through the web interface or API.

#### Web Interface Setup

1. **Access Settings**: Navigate to Settings → Webhooks
2. **Create New Webhook**: Click "Add Webhook"
3. **Configure Details**:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the webhook
   - **URL**: Endpoint that will receive the webhook calls
   - **Events**: Select which events trigger the webhook
4. **Test & Save**: Test the webhook and save configuration

#### API Configuration

```bash
# Create webhook via API
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Slack Notifications",
    "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK",
    "events": ["memo.created", "memo.updated", "memo.deleted"],
    "active": true
  }' \
  "https://your-memos-instance.com/api/v1/webhooks"
```

### Webhook Events

Memos supports various event types that can trigger webhooks:

| Event | Description | Trigger |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `memo.created` | New memo created | User creates a memo |
| `memo.updated` | Memo content modified | User edits existing memo |
| `memo.deleted` | Memo deleted/archived | User deletes or archives memo |
| `memo.shared` | Memo shared publicly | User makes memo public |
| `user.created` | New user registered | New user account created |
| `user.updated` | User profile modified | User updates profile |
| `resource.uploaded` | File uploaded | User uploads attachment |
| `system.backup` | Backup completed | Automated backup finishes |

### Webhook Payload Format

All webhooks receive a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/webhook",
  "activityType": "memo.created",
  "creator": "users/1",
  "memo": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "memos/123",
    "content": "This is a new memo #important",
    "createTime": "2025-08-19T12:00:00Z",
    "updateTime": "2025-08-19T12:00:00Z",
    "visibility": "PRIVATE"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `activityType` field indicates what triggered the webhook (e.g., `memo.created`, `memo.updated`, `memo.deleted`). The `memo` field contains the full memo object when applicable.
</Callout>

## Integration Examples

### Basic Webhook Handler

Here's a simple example of receiving and processing Memos webhooks:

```javascript
// Basic webhook handler (Node.js/Express)
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhooks/memos', (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  
  console.log(`Received webhook: ${payload.activityType}`);
  console.log(`Creator: ${payload.creator}`);
  
  if (payload.memo) {
    console.log(`Memo ID: ${payload.memo.id}`);
    console.log(`Content: ${payload.memo.content}`);
  }
  
  // Process the webhook based on activity type
  switch (payload.activityType) {
    case 'memo.created':
      // Handle new memo
      break;
    case 'memo.updated':
      // Handle memo update
      break;
    case 'memo.deleted':
      // Handle memo deletion
      break;
  }
  
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server running on port 3000');
});
```

### Forwarding to Slack

To send notifications to Slack, forward the webhook payload:
  
```javascript
app.post('/webhooks/to-slack', (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  
  // Format message for Slack
  let slackMessage = {
    text: `📝 ${payload.activityType}: ${payload.memo?.content?.substring(0, 100) || 'N/A'}`
  };
  
  // Send to Slack
  fetch(process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(slackMessage)
  })
  .then(() => res.status(200).json({ status: 'sent' }))
  .catch(err => res.status(500).json({ error: err.message }));
});
```

## Security and Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important**: Memos currently does not send cryptographic signatures with webhook requests. If you need to secure your webhook endpoints, consider implementing IP allowlisting, using HTTPS with authentication tokens in the URL, or placing webhooks behind an authentication proxy.
</Callout>

### Security Best Practices

- **Use HTTPS endpoints** for webhook URLs to encrypt data in transit
- **Implement IP allowlisting** if your webhook receiver has a fixed IP address
- **Use authentication tokens in URLs** for additional security (e.g., `https://your-server.com/webhook?token=secret`)
- **Log webhook activities** for security auditing and debugging
- **Place webhooks behind authentication** using reverse proxy or API gateway

### Performance Tips

- **Process webhooks asynchronously** for better performance
- **Implement proper retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Set appropriate timeouts** to prevent hanging requests
- **Monitor webhook endpoint** health and response times

## Troubleshooting

### Testing Webhooks

Test your webhook endpoint with a sample payload:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-webhook.sh

WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/webhook"
TEST_PAYLOAD='{
  "url": "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/webhook",
  "activityType": "memo.created",
  "creator": "users/1",
  "memo": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "memos/123",
    "content": "Test memo for webhook",
    "createTime": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'",
    "updateTime": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'",
    "visibility": "PRIVATE"
  }
}'

echo "Testing webhook..."
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "$TEST_PAYLOAD" \
     "$WEBHOOK_URL" \
     -w "HTTP Status: %{http_code}\nResponse Time: %{time_total}s\n"
```

### Common Issues

**Webhook Not Triggered**
- Check webhook configuration in Settings → Webhooks
- Verify the URL is accessible from your Memos instance
- Check logs for error messages

**Timeout Issues**
- Increase timeout values in your webhook handler
- Process webhooks asynchronously to avoid blocking
- Return HTTP 200 quickly and process in background

**SSL Certificate Issues**
- Ensure your webhook endpoint has a valid SSL certificate
- For development, consider using services like ngrok
