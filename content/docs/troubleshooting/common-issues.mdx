## Port already in use

Change the port with `--port` or `MEMOS_PORT` and restart the server.

## Cannot write to the data directory

Ensure the data directory exists and is writable by the Memos process. You can set it with `--data` or `MEMOS_DATA`.

## Database connection errors

Verify the driver and DSN:

- `MEMOS_DRIVER` should be `sqlite`, `mysql`, or `postgres`.
- `MEMOS_DSN` should use the correct DSN format for your database.

## Reverse proxy issues

If you run behind a reverse proxy, make sure:

- `MEMOS_INSTANCE_URL` matches the public URL
- The proxy forwards standard headers (`Host`, `X-Forwarded-*`)
