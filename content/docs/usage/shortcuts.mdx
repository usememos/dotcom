Shortcuts are saved filters that help you jump to a specific subset of memos quickly.

## Create a shortcut

1. Open the shortcuts section in the sidebar.
2. Create a new shortcut and give it a title.
3. Enter a filter expression to define which memos it should show.

## Manage shortcuts

Shortcuts can be edited or deleted from the same section in the sidebar. They sync with your account settings.
