## 1. Install Memos

Pick a deployment method:

- [Docker](/docs/deploy/docker)
- [Docker Compose](/docs/deploy/docker-compose)
- [Build from source](/docs/deploy/development)

## 2. Open your instance

After the server starts, open the instance URL in your browser.

- Docker default: `http://localhost:5230`
- Binary default: `http://localhost:8081`

## 3. Create the first admin account

If the instance has not been initialized, Memos will redirect you to the sign-up flow to create the first administrator account.

## 4. Create your first memo

Use the editor to write a short note and save it. Memos stores content as plain text and renders it with Markdown.

```markdown
# First memo

Hello from Memos.

- Write in Markdown
- Add tags like #getting-started
```

## 5. Next steps

- Learn the [Markdown syntax](/docs/usage/writing-markdown)
- Organize notes with [tags](/docs/usage/tags)
- Save filters as [shortcuts](/docs/usage/shortcuts)
