In the age of information, not all knowledge is text-based. Sometimes, you need to store and manage various types of media, such as images, videos, and other non-textual content. **Resources**, when combined with Memos, offer a powerful solution for handling and organizing these valuable assets. This document will guide you through the efficient management of resources within Memos.

## What Are Resources?

Resources are digital assets that complement your Memos by providing non-textual content, such as images, videos, audio files, and more. They serve as a visual and multimedia accompaniment to your text-based notes, enhancing your understanding and knowledge retention.

## Storing Resources in Memos

Resources are seamlessly integrated into Memos, making it easy to access and reference them alongside your textual content. Here's how to make the most of this feature:

1. **Uploading Resources**: When creating or editing a Memo, you can upload and attach resources to it. This process is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing you to quickly add multimedia content to your notes.

2. **Resource Types**: Memos support a wide range of resource types, including images, videos, audio files, and documents. This versatility ensures you can store and manage various types of non-textual content.

3. **Preview and Playback**: Resources are not just stored; they can also be previewed or played directly within the Memo. This feature allows you to engage with your multimedia content without leaving the Memo interface.

4. **Enhancing Comprehension**: Combining textual content with multimedia resources can significantly enhance your understanding of complex concepts or subjects.

## Wrapping It Up

Resources within Memos offer an effective way to manage and reference non-textual content, enriching your knowledge management system. By combining multimedia content with textual notes and efficiently organizing resources, you can unlock new dimensions of understanding and creativity.

Start attaching images, videos, and more to your Memos today and experience the benefits of a truly multimedia knowledge management system.

## Uploading video and audio files to Memos

By default, you can upload resources up to 30 MB in size. You can increase this limit by going to storage settings and changing "maximum upload size" to a higher value.
