This feature allows you to personalize your Memos experience, making it uniquely your own. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to implement custom styles and scripts on your Memos page.

## Accessing Custom Style and Script

To begin, follow these steps:

- Log in to your Memos account with admin access;
- Open the **Setting** page and select the **System** section;
- You will see the `Additional style` and `Additional script` inputs;

## Customizing with CSS

_Custom CSS allows you to change the look and feel of your Memos page._

- In the **Additional style** section, locate the CSS editor.
- Start writing your CSS code. You can customize various aspects, such as fonts, colors, margins, and more.
- Use CSS selectors to target specific elements on your page. For example, to change the background color of your Memos page, you can use:
  ```css
  body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
  ```
- After adding your custom CSS, click "Save" and reload the page to see the changes instantly on your page.

## Enhancing Functionality with JavaScript

_Custom JavaScript allows you to add interactive features and automation to your Memos._

- In the **Additional script** section, locate the JavaScript editor.
- Write your JavaScript code. You can add interactivity, automate tasks, or even create dynamic content.
- Ensure your JavaScript code is well-structured and free from errors.
- For example, you can create a simple alert when the page loads:
  ```javascript
  window.onload = function () {
    alert("Welcome to my custom Memos page!");
  };
  ```
- Once you've added your JavaScript, click "Save" to make the changes active.

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices
