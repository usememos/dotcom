In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to implement custom styles and scripts on your Memos page.

## Accessing Custom Style and Script

To begin, follow these steps:

## Customizing with CSS

_Custom CSS allows you to change the look and feel of your Memos page._

- In the **Additional style** section, locate the CSS editor.
- Start writing your CSS code. You can customize various aspects, such as fonts, colors, margins, and more.
- Use CSS selectors to target specific elements on your page. For example, to change the background color of your Memos page, you can use:

    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
  ```
- After adding your custom CSS, click "Save" and reload the page to see the changes instantly on your page.

_Custom JavaScript allows you to add interactive features and automation to your Memos._

- In the **Additional script** section, locate the JavaScript editor.
- Write your JavaScript code. You can add interactivity, automate tasks, or even create dynamic content.
- Ensure your JavaScript code is well-structured and free from errors.
- For example, you can create a simple alert when the page loads:
  ```javascript
  alert("Welcome to my custom Memos page!");  
  ```
- Once you've added your JavaScript, click "Save" to make the changes active.
