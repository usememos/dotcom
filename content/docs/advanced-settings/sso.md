title: Single Sign-On(SSO)
---

**Single Sign-On(SSO)** is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials (e.g., name and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.

Memos supports SSO integration with OAuth 2.0 standard.

## Create a new SSO provider

As an admin, you can create a new SSO provider in Settings > SSO.
