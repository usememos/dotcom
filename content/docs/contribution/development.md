Memos is built with a curated tech stack. It is optimized for developer experience and is very easy to start working on the code:

- It has no external dependency.
- It requires zero config.

## Prerequisite

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

## Steps

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/usememos/memos
   ```

2. Start backend server

   ```bash
   make backend
   ```

3. Start frontend UI
