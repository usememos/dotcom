The following options can be set at startup to adjust some of the server's behavior. Options can be passed either as command line arguments to the **memos** binary or as environment variables.

Environment | CLI Flag | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
MEMOS_MODE | --mode | prod | Sets the mode of the server, influencing its runtime behavior and the database used. Can be **prod** (production), **dev** (development) or **demo** (demonstration).  
MEMOS_ADDR | --addr | 0.0.0.0 (all) |Specifies the address on which the server will listen for incoming connections.
MEMOS_PORT | --port | 5230 |Sets the port on which the server will be accessible.
MEMOS_DATA | --data | /var/opt/memos | Specifies the directory where Memos will store its data.
MEMOS_DRIVER | --driver | sqlite | Sets the database driver to be used by Memos. Can be **sqlite**, **postgres** or **mysql**.
MEMOS_DSN | --dsn |  | Specifies the database source name (DSN) for connecting to the database. Note that each database driver has its own format for specifying the DSN. See the [database documentation](/docs/install/database) for more information.

{% admonition icon="important" %}
 Special characters in the **DSN** username and password must be escaped, such as converting `=` to `%3D`. Refer to the [Connection URIs documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6) for more details. Tools like [URL Encoder](https://www.urlencoder.org/) can assist with this process.
