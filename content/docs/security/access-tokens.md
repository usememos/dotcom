## Call the API with an access token

To call the API with an access token, you need to add the `Authorization` header to your request.

```
GET /api/v1/memo
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

For example with `curl`:

```shell
curl https://demo.usememos.com/api/v1/memo \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```
