title: Reverse Proxy
description: Run Memos behind HTTPS.
---

For production, run Memos behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik, etc.) and serve HTTPS.

## Recommended settings

- Set `MEMOS_INSTANCE_URL` to the public URL of your instance.
- Forward standard proxy headers (`Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-For`).
- Restrict access to the admin interface as needed.
