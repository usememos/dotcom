## TL;DR

* 👋 **Removed shortcuts**. Shortcut was an experimental feature with flaws in its design, and had not been updated for a long time. We will improve search related logic and performance in upcoming versions, to gradually achieve the design goals of shortcut.
* Added tag suggestions popup in memo editor; Thanks @maciej-ka
* Improved the display style of images;
* Fixed page crushed when rendering large amount of memos;
* Fixed error when updating memo content;
